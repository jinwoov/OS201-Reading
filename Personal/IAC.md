# Infrastructure as code
- automate, you can deploy and 
- building your application on kubernettes
- decide to use VM 
- to connect you need vpc for k8s and vm
- infrastructure as code
    - `imperative` is like step by step 
        - cli or bash script
        - cli create k8s
        - cli create VM
        - cli create VPC
        - provides step-by-step 
        - using the cloud tool to step by step
        - multiple approach
    - `declarative` approach
        - terraform: final state and the terraform does work for you
        - define k8s resource, vm resource, vpc resource
        - manage through config
        - easily manage
        - end up with same infrastructure
- Dev-ops
    - write some code
    - test 
    - then push it into production
    - always working
    - versioning is easier
    - best approach for automation
- immutable: can't be change.
    - need a database.
    - all of the environment 
    - every time you want to make versioning, you bring in old one along with new environment, then you can bring down the old one
