# Data Repair and Disposal

## SSD Data Recovery Best Practices

- Solid State Drives(SDD) has greater advantage over HDD.
- The primary advantage is that SDD use nonvolatile memory chips and improves performance and loading speed.
- SDD doesn't have revolution like HDD.
- The longevity of SDD is found to be shorter than HDD
- The flash drive on SDD wears out over time and capacitors, power suppy and controller chips all make SDD more prone to electrical failure
- SDD's deprecation can be unforeseeable and unavoidable, which is why its good idea to backup before that happens.
- SDD can be retrievable but not fully functional again
- There is no way or hard to detect if SSD is failing. 
- The bad blocks on SDD can be a sign of possible failure
- If you see file system requires repair but physicl defect software shows now damage.
- If the drives crashes while booting up but works after several boots
- If some of the file becomes read-only

**How do you fix a failed SSD?**
- Formatting the driver can help with the issue
- Power cycling the SSD. Unplug and plug back in can solve the problem
- Idling the boot menu. Have the computer sit in BIOS setting menu for 30 min
- Update SSD driver can solve the issue
- Updating firmware of the hard drive can solve this issue as well.

- The data recovery is definitely achievable, however is very difficult process. Many SSD has built-in recovery wizard that retrieve deleted files and allow MSPs to resotre partitions or any individual files as needed.
- The best practice to proactive on SSD failure is to
    - Download and use free software to monitor SSD health
    - Find SSD with S.M.A.R.T. (Self, monitoring, analysis, and reporting technology) that warns user of potential failure.
    - Have a backup plan to regularly backup important files and drives.
