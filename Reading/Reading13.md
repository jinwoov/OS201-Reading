# Virtual Networking with GNS3

---

## Getting Started with GNS3

- GNS3 is used by hundreds of thousands of network engineers worldwide to emulate, configure, test and troubleshoot virtual and real networks.
- It allows you to run few devices on your laptop
- GNS3 is open source free software
- GNS3 allows network engineers to virtualize ral hardware devices for over 10 years.
- GNS3 consists of two software components
    - GUI: GNS3 all in one software
        - it is graphical user interface
        - you can create your topology using this software
    - VM: GNS3 virtual machine
- Server options:
    - When topology of devices are created, it has to be run by a server process
        1. Local GNS3 server
        2. Local GNS3 VM
        3. Remote GNS3 VM
    - The local GNS3 server runs locally on the same PC.
    - When running GNS3 on VM you can do it locally or using virtualization software such as VMware workstation, Virtualbox, or Hyper-V. 
- Emulation: GNS3 mimics or emulate the hardware of a device and you run actual images on the virtual device.
- Simulation: simulates the features and functionality of a device as a switch.
- Dynamips is an older technology that emulates Cisco hardware.
- The recommended Cisco images to use with GNS3 are those from Cisco VIRL.
- GNS3 is useful for learning and teaching.It is often used for Cisco CCNA exam.
- The entire topology can be created and ru non a single laptop.
