## Computer networking 1

- Computer networking is a group of computers that are linked to communicate each other
- Host that sends the data is called client and host that receiving the data is called servers
- Each system is connected by communication links and packets switches.
- Different link can have different rates of transmission and it is called transmission rate.
- `Packets` are sent through the network to the destination end system.
- The one that translate this packets are called routers and link-layer switches.
- End system, internet runs protocols that control he sending and receiving of information within the internet. 
- The transmission control protocol (TCP) and the internet protocol (IP) are two of the most important protocols in the internet.
- IP arrange the format of the packet that are sent and received among router and end system. 
- The Internetâ€™s principal protocols are collectively known as TCP/IP.
- The stand of the internet was developed by Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) into documents called request for comments (RFCs)
- Layer Architecture
    - Internet is organized as Layer Architecture
    - When google image search, server has to package with necessary headers.
    - Once it reaches the client, reverse takes place.

- Steps from server to the client
     1. When the server gets the request, it first convert it to a packet and add the `Application Layer` header
     2. This protocols include HTTP (this provides web document request and transfer), SMTP(which provides for transfer of e-mail messages),
