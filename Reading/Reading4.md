## Professor Messer
- Identifying the problems
- identifying the symptom
- Ask a lot of question
- if things are working fine before and it started not working after then find out
- approach multiple problems individually
- Establish a theory
    - Start with the obvious
    - confirm the theory
- Test the theory
    - if the theory doesn't work then go next theory
- Create a plan of action
    - Build the plan
    - Correct the issue with a minimum of impact
    - Identify potential effect
- Implement the solution
    - fix the issues
    - if its critical problem then help from 3rd party
    - test and see if its fixed
- Verify full system
    - create a future plan to prevent it from happening again
- Document finding

## From The Reading
- Ask many question as possible and collect information
- Do some investigation, if its multiple issues, break it down to different components
- Start thinking what might've caused the problem
- Then start developing theory, what might've caused the problem.
- Then go down list and start from top, test out the theories that might've caused particular issue.
- Make sure that you have plan B,C... incase original plan doesn't work out.
- Once you apply the fix, test out the original problem to see same issue occurs. This could be accomplish through bringing the customer to test out the device.
- Create a preventative measure to make sure that this problem doesn't arise next time.
    - Document how you fixed that issue, so that you can apply that for next time.
