Site Survey
ABC Electronics is a small business in Pasadena, California that sells computer parts online. The IT manager needs to completely audit the organization’s IT processes, assets, and services. The site survey is the first step in documenting all of the information in an organized and accessible fashion.

A site survey was performed using a contractor. The IT manager guided the contractor through the facility, and explained that the company uses a cloud-based phone system. The company runs RingCentral Cloud PBX VoIP phone service on 10 Cisco SPA504G VoIP phones with IP addresses of 10.10.1.5-10.10.1.15. When users experience issues with the phone system, they email it@abcelectronics.com. This is one of the most important services due to its relevance to the sales department’s ability to represent the company while making calls.

ABC Electronics uses a Dropbox for Business account as a cloud file storage solution. The IT manager mentioned that contact information regarding support for Dropbox Business is on their website. The service is accessed at Dropbox.com and the Marketing VP is responsible for this service.

A Honeywell Commercial Security system is installed that employees use to access different parts of the building with their proximity badge. The IT manager did not have their contact info available but mentioned to look on Honeywell Commercial Security’s website for the Technical Support email. Along with the phone system, this is a top priority service to keep running due to security concerns. The operations of the security badge system are overseen by the security manager.

A number of non-IT services were mentioned, including electrical services from Pasadena Water and Power. The delivery of electrical service is supervised by the facilities manager.

There are a total of 10 Dell Optiplex 7020 small form-factor (Intel Core i5-4570 3.2Ghz, 8GB RAM, 500GB HDD (platter drives), DVDRW, Windows 10 Pro 64bit) computer workstations occupying IP addresses 10.10.0.16-10.10.0.26. The IT manager mentioned there is a “Contact Technical Support” website on Dell.com used to submit hardware issues with Dell workstations.

One of these workstations hosts Quickbooks, a critical software used by Payroll. If users have issues with Quickbooks, they email fintech@abcelectronics.com.

There are two Macbook Air (13-inch, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage) laptops running Catalina on IP addresses 10.10.0.26 and 10.10.0.27. These are used by marketing for graphic design purposes. The IT manager mentioned that both systems are protected with AppleCare+, and contact information for support is available on the AppleCare+ website.

In the network closet area of ABC Electronics, two Cisco SF250-48 48-Port Fast Ethernet Smart Switch (SF250-48-K9-NA) are installed in the network closet at 10.10.0.2 and 10.10.0.3. A single Sonicwall TZ300 Firewall device resides at IP 10.10.0.1 serving the entire network. A single ARRIS SURFboard SB8200 DOCSIS 3.1 Gigabit Cable Modem delivers 300 Mbps cable internet to the network from its ISP, Centurylink. Internet issues are reported to it@abcelectronics.com.

After surveying the facility with the IT manager, the site survey contractor submitted the above information to you and invoiced ABC Electronics.
