# OSI model


please do not throw sausage pizza away

Physical -> Data link -> Network -> transport -> session -> presentation -> application

electrical cable -> mac address - blanking lights, LLC, switches -> TCP/IP protocol lives, IP address, Router -> transfer data, px, tcp, udp -> application connections, netBios -> data to your screen, jpeg/gif -> apps, FTP, HTTP, SMTP, 

UDP: persistent stream of data on/off

ubiquity has same configuration as sonicwall


tx = tranfer
rx = receives
client = user of the system
server = host of the system
